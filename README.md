# AE_basic_denoise_anomalies_detection
Hi, this project contains the following:
- building an autoencoder model for compressing input image to a latent vector and reconstructing it, which I call the basic part.
- building an autoencoder model for denoising images with noises.
- building an autoencoder model for detecting anomalies on 5000 Electrocardiograms. 

This little project references primarily from a TensorFlow tutorial:  https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/autoencoder. 

My aim is to rewrite the code line by line (sometimes my codes or comments will be different) and try to understand what they're teaching.
