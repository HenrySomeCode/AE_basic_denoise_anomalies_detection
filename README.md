# AE : The Basic, Denoising and Anomalies Detection.

Hi, this project contains the following:
- Building an autoencoder model for compressing input image to a latent vector and reconstructing it, which I call the basic part.
- Building an autoencoder model for denoising images with noises.
- Building an autoencoder model for detecting anomalies on 5000 Electrocardiograms. 

This little project references primarily from a TensorFlow tutorial:  https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/autoencoder. 

My aim is to rewrite the code line by line (sometimes my codes or comments will be different) and try to understand what they're teaching. You can question me about anything on the code or relevant topics!
